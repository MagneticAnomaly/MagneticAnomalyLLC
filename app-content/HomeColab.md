# HomeColab: The Future of Real Estate Collaboration

## The Problem
Home buying is inherently collaborative, but the tools aren't. Couples are stuck sharing links in messy group texts, losing track of what they liked, and arguing over favorites. Meanwhile, real estate agents are overwhelmed by notification noise, struggling to decipher their clients' true intent, and acting as mediators instead of trusted advisors.

## Meet HomeColab (For Buyers)
**Stop scrolling. Start collaborating.**

HomeColab is the ultimate shared workspace for homebuyers. Whether you're a couple looking for your dream home or a solo buyer organizing your search, HomeColab brings clarity to the chaos.

### Key Features
- **Universal Link Unfurling:** Found a home on Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com? Just paste the link. HomeColab instantly unfurls it into a beautiful, standardized property card. No more bouncing between different apps.
- **Partner Alignment:** Stop arguing, start aligning. Our unique "Alignment Score" highlights the properties you *both* love, making it easy to focus on the homes that won't cause friction.
- **Smart Organization:** Vote on properties, leave private notes, and organize your favorites into curated, Pinterest-style boards.
- **Selective Agent Inclusion:** Chat privately with your partner, and only loop in your agent when you need them by tagging `@realtor`. Get answers without the pressure.
